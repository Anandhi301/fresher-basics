X.a What?
  
  It means storing and accessing shared resources,data and information over internet instead of hard drive to computers and other devices on-demand in a pay for use basis.The services provided by cloud computing are Infrastructure As A Service,Platform As A Service and Software As A Service.Simply it is delivery of required resources over internet.

X.b Why?

   Because it provides flexibility,security,cost reduction,can work from anywhere,up to date software and choice of applications.

2. Client

X.a What?

	A client is the requesting program or user in a client/server relationship.It is an application that runs on a personal computer or workstation and relies on a server to perform some operations.It retrieves information from or uses resources provided by the server or main computer.Each client connects to a central server or mainframe that allows processing to be done on the client side instead of the server side and reduces the processing requirements of the server. A client does not share any of its resources, but requests a server's content or service function.
		         
X.b Why?

	Clients are used because all files are stored in a central location,network peripherals are controlled centrally,backups and network security is controlled centrally and users can access shared data which is centrally controlled.

X.b Why?

	Servers are used because they are used in a single place and can solve all the problems in one place.It provides ease of management, and it is cost effective.

4. HTTP

X.a What?
	Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web. HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands. For example, when you enter a URL in your browser, this actually sends an HTTP command to the Web server directing it to fetch and transmit the requested Web page.It is the set of rules for transferring files (text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) on the World Wide Web. As soon as a Web user opens their Web browser, the user is indirectly making use of HTTP. HTTP is an application protocol that runs on top of the TCP/IP suite of protocols

X.b Why?

	HTTP is used to transfer files from a Web server into a browser window to view a Web page that is on the Internet. With HTTP, files are transported only from the server onto the workstation's browser. The files are transferred but not downloaded, therefore not copied into the memory of the workstation.

	API  is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. The API specifies how software components should interact and APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.  

X.b Why?

	It is used because it acts as a door or window into a software program, allowing other programs to interact with it without the need for a developer to share its entire code.

6. JSON

X.a What?

	JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language.It uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs. It is the primary data format used for asynchronous browser/server communication (AJAJ), largely replacing XML.

X.b Why?

	It is used because it is a lightweight format.
